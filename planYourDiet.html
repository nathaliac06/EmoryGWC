<!-- An element with a unique id -->
<h2 id="myHeader2">Other Tips to Try</h2>

<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
<h2 class="heading">Eat a Variety of Foods</h2>
<p class="text-content">Eating a variety of foods is important because no single food can provide all the nutrients needed for a healthy diet. Variety means choosing the diverse foods within each food group. 
</p>

<h2 class="heading">Base your Diet on Plenty of Foods Rich in Carbohydrates</h2>
<p class="text-content">Carbohydrates are your body's main source of energy: They help fuel your brain, kidneys, heart muscles, and central nervous system. For instance, fiber is a carbohydrate that aids in digestion, helps you feel full, and keeps blood cholesterol levels in check.
</p>

<h2 class="heading">Replace Saturated with Unsaturated Fat</h2>
<p class="text-content">If you want to reduce your risk of heart disease, it's best to reduce your overall fat intake and swap saturated fats for unsaturated fats. There's good evidence that replacing saturated fats with some unsaturated fats can help to lower your cholesterol level.

<h2 class="heading">Enjoy Plenty of Fruits and Vegetables</h2>
<p class="text-content">Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin C and potassium. They're an excellent source of dietary fibre, which can help to maintain a healthy gut and prevent constipation and other digestion problems. A diet high in fibre can also reduce your risk of bowel cancer.

<h2 class="heading">Reduce Salt and Sugar Intake</h2>
<p class="text-content">Too many people eat too much saturated fat, added salt, added sugars and alcohol. Even reducing these by small amounts can make us healthier. It can help us manage our weight better and reduce our risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, some cancers and chronic kidney disease.

<h2 class="heading">Eat Regularly, Control the Portion Size</h2>
<p class="text-content">Portion control is important because it allows you to have a tight handle on how many calories you are presumably consuming. This way, you eat what your body needs, instead of mindlessly overindulging.

<h2 class="heading">Drink Plenty of Water</h2>
<p class="text-content"> You need water to replenish the lost fluid from sweat. You also need enough water in your system to have healthy stool and avoid constipation.
 
<h2 class="heading">Maintain A Healthy Body Weight</h2>
<p class="text-content">Maintaining a healthy weight is important for health. In addition to lowering the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and high blood pressure, it can also lower the risk of many different cancers.

<h2 class="heading">Get Enough Sleep</h2>
<p class="text-content">Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. Getting enough quality sleep at the right times can help protect your mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety. The way you feel while you're awake depends in part on what happens while you're sleeping.
